Check the the initial prototype, [go to Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/gx1OntnxXen64lYRgscxPS/Card-checker). 

## About The Project

This project started as a JavaScript practice from Codecademy (JS Syntax Part II / Challenge: Credit Card Checker) to test on console, I decided to bring it to life giving it web functionality. Some extra features such as Credit Card Generation and validations have been added to the initial logic.
